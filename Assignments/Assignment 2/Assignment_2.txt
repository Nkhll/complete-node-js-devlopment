1. Create a npm project and install Express.js(Nodemon if you want)
2. Create an Express.js app which funnels the requests through 2 middleware functions 
that log something to the console and resturn response.
3. Handle request to "/" and "/users" such that each request only has one hanlder/ middleware 
that does something with it(eg. Send dummy response).
